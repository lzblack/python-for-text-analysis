    "As you've seen in the [State of the tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GlNDD7qbP4) video, `Matplotlib` is one of the core libraries for visualization. It's feature-rich, and there are many tutorials and examples showing you how to make nice graphs. It's also fairly clunky, however, and the default settings don't make for very nice graphs. But because `Matplotlib` is so powerful, no one wanted to throw the library away. So now there are several modules that provide wrapper functions around `Matplotlib`, so as to make it easier to use and produce nice-looking graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Seaborn` is a visualization library that adds a lot of functionality and good-looking defaults to Matplotlib.\n",
    "* `Pandas` is a data analysis library that provides plotting methods for its `dataframe` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, it's all still Matplotlib. So if you use any of these libraries to create a graph, and you want to customize the graph a little, it's usually a good idea to go through the `Matplotlib` documentation. Meanwhile, the developers of `Matplotlib` are still improving the library. If you have 20 minutes to spare, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU) on the new default colormap that will be used in Matplotlib 2.0. It's a nice talk that highlights the importance of color theory in creating visualizations.\n",

It's usually easier to export the graph to GEXF and visualize it using [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) or [SigmaJS](http://sigmajs.org/). Gephi also features plugins, which enable you to create interactive visualizations. See [here](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/dm-graphs/) for code and a link to a demo that I made.\n",
