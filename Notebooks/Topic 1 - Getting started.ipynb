    "Welcome to the course! You are now in the Jupyter Notebook environment, running the notebook for Topic 1.\n",
    "Notebooks are pretty straightforward. Some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cells in a notebook contain code or text. If you run a cell, it will either run the code or render the text.\n",
    "* There are five ways to run a cell:\n",
    "    1. Click the 'play' button next to the 'stop' and 'refresh' button in the toolbar.\n",
    "    2. Alt + Enter runs the current cell and creates a new cell.\n",
    "    3. Ctrl + Enter runs the current cell without creating a new cell. (Cmd + Enter on a Mac.)\n",
    "    4. Shift + Enter runs the current cell and moves to the next one.\n",
    "    5. Use the menu and select Cell/Run all.\n",
    "* The instructions are written in Markdown. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a nice Markdown cheatsheet if you want to write some more.\n",

    "**At the end of this week, you will be able to:**\n",

    "- Assign values to variables.\n",
    "- Find and use object methods.\n",
    "- Use different built-in classes, such as *strings* and *lists*.\n",
    "- Use Python's *slicing* and *indexing* notation.\n",

    "**We'll also touch upon:**\n",

    "- Tokenization: splitting up a text into sentences and words.\n",

    "You'll find that this week is a bit theoretical. That's because we need to agree on a common vocabulary, before we can move on to more practical matters. It might be a bit overwhelming at first, but you'll get used to it pretty quickly!\n",

    "* **String**: for representing text.\n",
    "* **Integer**: for representing whole numbers.\n",
    "* **Float**: for representing numbers with decimals.\n",
    "* **Tuple**: for representing immutable combinations of values.\n",
    "* **List**: for representing ordered sequences of objects.\n",
    "* **Set**: for representing unordered sets of objects.\n",
    "* **Dictionary**: to represent mappings between objects.\n",
    "* ..and **functions**: to manipulate objects, or to produce new objects given some input.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also read about the types in Python in the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html). Basically, what you need to know now is that each type has particular *affordances*, or associated things that you can do with them. When something is of a numeric type (integer, float), the Python interpreter knows that you can perform mathematical operations with that object. You cannot use those operations with strings, because it doesn't make sense to take the square root of the string \"Hello, world!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the same with vehicles and food in real life. Anything that is of the type *vehicle* can be used to get around and possibly transport goods. But you cannot eat a vehicle.
